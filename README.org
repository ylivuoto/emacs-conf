* Emacs configuration
All the sections below will contain declarations for my emacs
setup. When using .org configuration file, please include a short line
in your .emacs or init.el file

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/my-conf.org"))
#+END_SRC

or similar to include your fresh config file! Also, be careful when
making changes. Sometimes, when making changes to settings
graphically, emacs will create some new lines to .emacs file and there
will be duplicates with the .org config file - watch out those!
